# NBA-Shot-Success-Predictor

## Installs
    Need to install packages: os, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, cross_validate, time, and xgboost using pip
    Note: os, time, and xgboost should be the only packages not previously installed from the course. 

## Data
    The csv file should be in the github and can be cloned initially, but not pushed. If this fails the data can be downloaded from this
    link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs/data 
    It must be named NBA_Height.csv and placed in the data subfolder. 
    
## Running the code
    All code should be ran from the app.ipynb file. The necessary print statements to understand the results for each model are included
    in the models individual files.
